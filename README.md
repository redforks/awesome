# README

1. [Cue Language](https://cuelang.org/) Data validation and template language, support for JSON Schema, OpenAPI, Protobuf, and more.
   Bindings for Go, Python, Java, and JavaScript.

1. [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc-py.github.io/) Markdown alternative. Shorter and cleaner and more formatting options.
   [Other alternatives](https://github.com/mundimark/awesome-markdown-alternatives), and also [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_documentation_generators)

## Rust

1. [vector](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector) Application log gather and transform tool, [Docs](https://vector.dev/docs/)
1. [predicates](https://docs.rs/predicates/2.1.1/predicates/) Functional programming style predicates for filtering and matching.
   Drawback: compile time is slow. I don't actually use it, that should be interesting to try.
   My another concern is that using closure, sometimes triggers hard to fix lifetime problems.
